# BedroomControl
A simple remote control for my bedroom devices

This requires the Q PHP API (https://github.com/mccollam/Qphp) to work.

It also requires the Bootstrap framework (http://getbootstrap.com) be in the same directory.

Description
-----------
This is a simple web-based remote control for the various Internet of Things devices I have lying around my bedroom.  It also serves as a simple example of the Belleds Q PHP API for controling the Q lights.

It's plain and simple, with the goal of being accessed on a rooted Nook Simple Touch.  (Thus the lack of color beyond grayscale for the elements.)

Future work will include control of power for devices, either via X10 or a network-enabled power strip.
